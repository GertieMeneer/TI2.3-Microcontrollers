Project made by me, and https://github.com/Stefsk-glitch

## Course Description
- In this course we were given a Big AVR 6 board with an ATmega128 chip.
- We had to make assignments and build projects to learn how a microcontroller actually works. We learned IO, JTAG, interrupts, counters, timers, ADC, DAC, PWM, SPI, I2C and UART.
- Our final assignment consisted of a temperature logging service, which utilized IO, timers, ADC and SPI.
